## Pertinent Questions

- Question 1: He said money isn't everything and don't chase the FAANG companies but aren't they among the best programmers in the world? Wouldn't that you take your skills to the next level?

- Question 2: You code in C, what are you doing that is requiring you to code in C?

## Lessons Learned

- Job hop early in career in regards to: Large vs small companies, startups vs. well-established, private sector vs. government, non-profit vs. for-profit, freelancing (not fun according to lecturer) and more.

- The software strategy in use can change throughout a single project, don't get attached to anything. Despite this, the software cycle is typically the same from company to company (not the same as strategy).

- Cross learning to things that you don't neccessarily do on a day to day basis can help you understand what you're doing better.

- Also noticed that his open of agile was flexible. He mentioned that agile is not defined well and that it means very different things to each company. That was a perspective I found interesting

- Another refreshing take was his opinion that all software is just a tool and you choose the best tool for the job. Do not get tied to any one stack.
