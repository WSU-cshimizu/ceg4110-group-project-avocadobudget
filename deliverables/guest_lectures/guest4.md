## Lessons Learned

- Job hop early in career in regards to: Large vs small companies, startups vs. well-established, private sector vs. government, non-profit vs. for-profit, freelancing (not fun according to lecturer) and more.

- The software strategy in use can change throughout a single project, don't get attached to anything. Despite this, the software cycle is typically the same from company to company (not the same as strategy).

- Cross learning to things that you don't neccessarily do on a day to day basis can help you understand what you're doing better.
