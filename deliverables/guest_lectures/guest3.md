## Pertinent Questions
## Question 1
- How do you handle the time difference between the workers in the India locations and the workers in the Dayton area? Do they work together?
## Question 2
- How do you determine what new trendy software/technologies is worth trying and will be around for the long run?

## Lessons Learned
- Not all teams are doing agile. Some teams agile doesn't neccessarily work as well, or they will be a different agile methodology. Teams have flexibility to do what works best for them.
- The number one issue is lack of communication, lack of planning and business process change (people don't want to change the way they do something). Development shouldn't start before there is a plan (can sometimes go against the methodology of agile).
- The most valuable projects are categorized by (profit - expense). This metric categorizes what projects have the highest priority as opposed to the time and/or man power expense.

  
- Master one thing instead of trying to be a full stack dev early in software career.
