# Group Retrospective

## What went well in the group...
* Everyone attended our weekly meetings consistently
* Everyone finished their tasks
* Everyone was responsive in communication
* Everyone was on board with a simple MVS in order to keep our workload reasonable

## What could have been better in the group...
* Team members could have provided a bigger warning that they would be unavailable for a week or so.
* Team members could have spent more time getting their environments set up and using github more frequently.
* Towards the end our team was more balanced in who did what. Communication at the beggining could have avoided some of this imbalance. 

## What went well in the class...
* The TA was very responsive to questions and willing to provide feedback. This was very helpful
* The guidelines were consistent and deadlines clear.
* The focus on github and documentation was helpful to see the software development process in a larger setting. 

## What could have been better in the class...
* More focus on agile and the different versions early in the class.
* I would have preffered fewer vistor sessions and more focus on some lectures on documentation and the process. 
* More check ins with the teams, maybe demos of what is done so far and feedback. Some teams might have benifited from that. 

## Further Comments
* Overall the class provided the opportunity to learn a new tech stack. Flask is an interesting minimal web framework.
* We do not have many other comments to make.
