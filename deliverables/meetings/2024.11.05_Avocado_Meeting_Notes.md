 * Report Summary:
 
   UI design is important for a smooth user experience. The first article covers common mistakes, like using too many styles, heavy shadows, and low contrast, which make interfaces confusing and bad. To improve design, it suggests keeping styles consistent, highlighting main buttons, organizing text style and confusing forms. It also stresses the importance of good alignment, high-quality images, and easy-to-click icons which means touch area should be more if icons in minimum size, particular in mobile or tab.

   The second article describes a userâ€™s frustration with recent changes to an application's interface, which feels confusing and difficult to use. They miss the old, simpler design that made it easy to find playlists and get relevant recommendations. This user wants more control over the layout and features.

   both articles highlight that good UI design should focus on making the experience easy, simple, focus on main functionalities, and meet end user requirements.
