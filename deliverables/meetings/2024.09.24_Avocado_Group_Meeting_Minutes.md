## Agenda
- Create template for requirements
- Add content to requirements document

## Notes
- All members worked on building up the template for reqs.md. 
- Worked on and finalized some of the schedule on the gantt chart for the remainder of the course.
- Finalized some of the mvs.md file in order to react to the content from today's lecture
- Finalized corrections to the sdp.md file after feedback from grading

## Action Items
- All members: Will contribute what they can over the next two days until next class. Idea is to fill out as much of the user story details as we can. This will drive us to defining the database, front end, and ui / ux requirements as a result of the user requirements for each user story identified in the compendium. 
- We will meet again Thursday to finalize the progress made.
- Abhik, Dev: Plan to start the testing plan after requirement specifications is finished.
